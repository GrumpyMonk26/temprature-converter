# Temprature Converter App

### Vanilla Javascript Project

#### Project description

##### The objective of this project is to develop a temperature converter that supports Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin formats. The final version of the project will feature three input fields for each of these temperature formats. When any of the inputs are modified, such as entering a value of 100 degrees Celsius, the equivalent temperature will be automatically displayed in Fahrenheit and Kelvin formats. Moreover, updating one input will dynamically reflect the changes in the other inputs in real-time. For instance, modifying the Fahrenheit input to 100 degrees will instantly reveal that it is equivalent to 37 degrees Celsius and 311 Kelvin.
##### To implement this project, we will explore the usage of the "onchange" event listener to track input changes. Additionally, we will employ a switch statement to handle changes based on the name of the input field being manipulated. Furthermore, CSS will be utilized to provide a modern aesthetic inspired by the newMorphISM design.
##### In summary, this project serves as an excellent opportunity to learn how to create a temperature converter using JavaScript and CSS. It will allow us to gain knowledge in tracking input changes using event listeners and switch statements, while also providing a visually appealing interface.
